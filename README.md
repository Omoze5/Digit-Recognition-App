## About the Digit Prediction App

This app uses a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits from the popular **MNIST dataset**. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each image being 28x28 pixels in grayscale. It has been a benchmark in the field of machine learning and deep learning for tasks involving image classification and pattern recognition. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on these digit images, the ('https://digit-recognition-app-cnn.streamlit.app/')[app] which was built using streamlit can accurately predict the digit present in an uploaded image. Simply upload an image of a digit, and the app will analyze it and provide its prediction!
